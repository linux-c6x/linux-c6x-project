This is the linux-c6x project

Top level plan:
X Make a very simple system (timer, console, maybe enet) 
X Test on CCS 3.3 windows simulator
X Verify w/ TI V7 compiler w/ COFF
X Merge my changes and ni-3.0 
X Bare metal test on Linux simulator
- Test on Linux simulator
X Bare metal test on real HW
X Test on real HW
- Configure & test enet & telnet 
- Merge my changes with VLX SOW Delivery 2
X Build uClibc
- Test uClibc w/ hello
- Use uClibc in SDK
- Build Busybox & use in min-root
- Restructure tool-wrapper for better VC (seperate editable content and use)
- Rebuild cilly (optional?)

Kernel Work:
- Backout V6 specific changes in common code
- Do TI V7 ELF for kernel (still COFF for app.  No modules)
- Do TI V7 ELF for static app
- Back out COFF specific changes in common code
- [here or later? Upport to 2.6.30+]
- Do ELF module loader
- Do non-pic dynamic loader (copy & fixup)
