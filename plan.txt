This is the linux-c6x project

Top level plan:
X Make a very simple system (timer, console, maybe enet) 
X Test on CCS 3.3 windows simulator
X Verify w/ TI V7 compiler w/ COFF
- Test on Linux simulator
- Test on real HW
- Merge my changes and ni-3.0 &| VLX SOW Delivery 1
- Backout V6 specific changes in common code
- Do TI V7 ELF for kernel (still COFF for app.  No modules)
- Do TI V7 ELF for static app
- Back out COFF specific changes in common code
- [here or later? Upport to 2.6.30+]
- Do ELF module loader
