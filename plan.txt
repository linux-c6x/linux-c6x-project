This is the linux-c6x project

Top level plan:
- Make a very simple system (timer, connsole, maybe enet) 
- Merge my changes and ni-3.0
- Verify w/ TI V7 compiler w/ COFF
- Backout V6 specific changes in common code
- Do TI V7 ELF for kernel (still COFF for app.  No modules)
- Do TI V7 ELF for static app
- Back out COFF specific changes in common code
- [here or later? Upport to 2.6.30+]
- Do ELF module loader
- Do non-pic dynamic loader (copy & fixup)
- Do pic model .so's
- Upport to 2.6.30+
